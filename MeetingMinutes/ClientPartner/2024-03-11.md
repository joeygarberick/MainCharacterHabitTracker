## Things clarified

## Client Use of the Project

Client uses the software seamlessly. He went through the main features, adding a vice, adding to its counter, locating to the graphs too see the changed displays, and then deleting vice. He clicked around for 5-10 minutes while talking with us about the features. He was happy with the new additions. One thing he tried to do to delete a habit was swipe it to the right, so maybe adding that in, as it is a more common UI feature.
