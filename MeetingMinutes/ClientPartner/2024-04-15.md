## Client Use of the Project

Client was able to work though the new features very easily. He was able to move around very well, he testing the vice creation, deletion, changing the statistics. He click around for about 10-20 minutes trying things out and asking questions. Overall the client and his team had a positive reaction to the application.
Some interactions were not user friendly but overall good.
