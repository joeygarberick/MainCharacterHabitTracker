- This is a flutter project meaning we utilize Dart's built-in linter for an analysis of our Dart codebase. 

        $ dart analyze

- The rules are configured using the `analysis_options.yaml` file in our project.

- Run the `dart analyze` before  a commit. 

- If any linting issues are detected the commit is stopped.
